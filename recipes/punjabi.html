    <h1>PANJABI</h1>
    <img src="./img/punjabi.jpg">
    <p>One of the most impressive things about Punjabi 
        food is its variety. While meat lovers can never have 
        enough of the evergreen Butter Chicken, Bhuna Gosht, 
        Tandoori Chicken and Amritsari Machchi, 
        vegetarian fare is equally delightful. Sarson ka Saag,
         Chole Bhature and Dal Makhni are just a handful of 
         vegetarian Punjabi specialities with fans across the globe. 
         Think of Punjab and you can imagine its earthy heritage of 
         lush green fields and robust lifestyle. What makes Punjab 
         different from the other states is its culinary treasure, 
         it is a state synonymous with food. Punjabi food is a lot 
         like Punjabis - rich, robust and full of life. Bold textures 
         and hearty ingredients are what make Punjabi cuisine so popular 
         all across North India.
