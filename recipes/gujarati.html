    <h1>GUJARATI</h1>
    <img class="siz" src="./img/gujarati.jpg">
    <p>Undhiyu is a one pot vegetable casserole dish that is the hallmark 
        of Gujarati vegetarian cuisine. Generally preparing undhiyu takes a 
        lot of time and needs patience. Traditionally the veggies are cooked 
        or fried in batches.This delicious recipe of surti undhiyu does not 
        take much time, as all the veggies along with the Methi muthia are 
        steamed in a pressure cooker. Though, if you want you can also cook 
        the veggies in a large pot or pan. Thus the recipe is easy as well 
        as healthy. I have also added less oil than what is generally added.
        Undhiyu is a personal favorite. I have had undhiyu many times while 
        living in Mumbai. One of the best undhiyu, I have had was at a Gujarati
         function in mithibai college, juhu, Mumbai. The entire Gujarati buffet 
        there was so good, right from the starters to the dessert. We took small
         portions of everything and had a hearty meal.Undhiyu is so called as it is 
        derived from the Gujarati word “undhu” which means upside down. Traditionally 
        the entire dish is cooked in earthen pots (called ‘matlu’ in Gujarati). The pots 
        are sealed and placed upside down in a fire pit dug in the ground. The slow cooking
         in the earthen pot gives the dish a rustic flavor and taste.
